* /etc/alternatives
	* It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or similar

	* The alternatives system aims to solve this problem. A generic name

	  functionality. The alternatives system and the system administrator
	  together determine which actual file is referenced by this generic
	  name.
	* The generic name is a symbolic link to a name in the alternatives
	  directory, which in turn is a symbolic link to the actual file
	  referenced. This is done so that the system administrator's changes
	  can be confined within the /etc directory.
